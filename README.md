# About

The PopupDB Project has been collecting data about Tech-Support-Scams and their popups since 2018.

Now it's time to go a different way, since it is no more possible for me to maintain the project as it was before.

In order to still fulfill the needs of the community and the main idea of the project, I am releasing the complete data of 2 1/2 years collecting popups.
This includes the databases, source codes and screenshots. (After the rewrite in early 2020).

The data has been carefully reviewed by myself, but still could contain slight mistakes, as it is not possible to go other 11375 rows of data by hand.
I hope you can understand that.

## Closing words


Thanks to the whole team, without which I wouldn't have been able to maintain the project in the first place.

Thanks to everyone who helped to search the popups! This wouldn't have existed without you!

And lastly, thanks to everyone who was a part of this project. 

It was a pleasure.
